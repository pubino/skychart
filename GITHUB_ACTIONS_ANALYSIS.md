# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline for SkyChart ARM64

## Executive Summary

**Yes, we can streamline the build pipeline with GitHub Actions**, but with important considerations around **ARM64 macOS runner availability**. The solution combines cloud-hosted runners (where available) with self-hosted runners as the recommended production approach.

## GitHub Actions ARM64 Support Analysis

### ✅ **Current ARM64 macOS Support**

**Good News:** GitHub now provides ARM64 macOS runners!

- **Available runners**: `macos-15-arm64`, `macos-14-arm64`, `macos-13-arm64`
- **Status**: Currently in **limited availability/preview**
- **Specifications**: Native Apple Silicon M-series processors
- **Software**: Full Xcode, Homebrew, development tools pre-installed

### 🎯 **Recommended Hybrid Approach**

The optimal strategy combines both cloud and self-hosted runners:

1. **Primary**: Self-hosted ARM64 runners (your Mac)
2. **Backup**: GitHub-hosted ARM64 runners (when available)  
3. **Fallback**: Cross-compilation support

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. **Cloud-Hosted ARM64 Runners** 
```yaml
runs-on: macos-15-arm64  # Native ARM64
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Zero infrastructure management
- ✅ Clean, consistent environment
- ✅ Native ARM64 performance
- ✅ Pre-installed development tools
- ✅ Automatic scaling

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ **Limited availability** (preview status)
- ⚠️ **Higher cost** than Linux runners
- ⚠️ **Queue times** during high demand
- ⚠️ **60GB disk space** limit

**Free Pascal Support:**
```bash
# Available via Homebrew on ARM64 runners
brew install fpc lazarus-ide qt@5
```

### 2. **Self-Hosted ARM64 Runners** (Recommended)
```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS, ARM64]
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Full control** over environment
- ✅ **No usage limits** or costs
- ✅ **Faster builds** (local execution)
- ✅ **Custom software** pre-installed
- ✅ **Guaranteed availability**

**Requirements:**
- 🔧 Your Mac as a GitHub runner
- 🔧 Runner agent setup and maintenance
- 🔧 Security considerations for private repos

## Technical Implementation

### **Pipeline Architecture**

Our GitHub Actions workflow provides:

1. **Multi-Strategy Build**
   - Primary: Cloud ARM64 runners (when available)
   - Fallback: Self-hosted runners
   - Graceful degradation between approaches

2. **Complete Automation** 
   - ✅ Dependency installation (Qt5, FPC, libraries)
   - ✅ Native ARM64 compilation
   - ✅ Professional app bundle creation
   - ✅ DMG distribution packaging
   - ✅ Automated testing and validation

3. **Artifact Management**
   - Build artifacts (30-day retention)
   - Distribution DMGs (90-day retention) 
   - Build logs and diagnostics
   - Automatic release creation

4. **Professional Distribution**
   - Tagged releases for main branch builds
   - Professional DMG downloads
   - Installation instructions
   - System requirements documentation

### **Key Workflow Features**

```yaml
# Trigger conditions
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master, macos-arm64 ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual triggering
```

**Build Steps:**
1. Environment setup and verification
2. Homebrew dependency installation  
3. Qt5 and FPC configuration
4. Automated build execution
5. Testing and validation
6. Professional packaging
7. Artifact upload and release creation

## Comparison: Cloud vs Self-Hosted

| Aspect | Cloud ARM64 Runners | Self-Hosted Runners |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Zero setup | ⚠️ Initial configuration required |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Fully managed | ⚠️ You maintain |
| **Cost** | ⚠️ Usage-based billing | ✅ Hardware cost only |
| **Availability** | ⚠️ Preview/limited | ✅ Always available |
| **Performance** | ✅ Good (M-series) | ✅ Excellent (your Mac) |
| **Environment Control** | ⚠️ Limited customization | ✅ Full control |
| **Security** | ✅ Isolated | ⚠️ Your network |
| **Scalability** | ✅ Auto-scaling | ⚠️ Limited to your hardware |

## Migration Benefits

### **From Current Manual Process:**
- ✅ **Complete automation** - No manual build steps
- ✅ **Consistent builds** - Eliminate "works on my machine"
- ✅ **Professional distribution** - Automatic DMG creation  
- ✅ **Quality assurance** - Automated testing on every commit
- ✅ **Release management** - Tagged releases with changelogs

### **Development Workflow Improvements:**
- ✅ **Pull request validation** - Builds tested before merge
- ✅ **Continuous integration** - Every commit verified
- ✅ **Artifact preservation** - All builds archived
- ✅ **Multi-branch support** - Feature branches buildable
- ✅ **Manual triggering** - Build on demand

## Recommendations

### **Phase 1: Self-Hosted Runner Setup** (Immediate)
1. **Setup GitHub runner on your Mac**
   ```bash
   # Download runner from GitHub repository settings
   # Configure as service for automatic startup
   ```

2. **Test the workflow** with your existing build scripts
3. **Validate end-to-end pipeline** functionality

### **Phase 2: Cloud Runner Integration** (Near-term)  
1. **Monitor ARM64 runner availability** expansion
2. **Test cloud builds** when runners become available
3. **Implement hybrid fallback** strategy

### **Phase 3: Production Optimization** (Long-term)
1. **Code signing integration** for distribution
2. **Apple notarization** for security compliance  
3. **Multi-architecture support** (Intel + ARM64)
4. **Automated testing matrix** across macOS versions

## Security Considerations

### **Self-Hosted Runners:**
- ⚠️ **Private repositories only** recommended
- 🔒 **Network isolation** for runner machine
- 🔒 **Regular security updates** for runner OS
- 🔒 **Access control** for runner management

### **Cloud Runners:**
- ✅ **Isolated execution** environment
- ✅ **No persistent state** between runs
- ✅ **Secure by default** configuration

## Cost Analysis

### **GitHub-Hosted ARM64 Runners:**
- **Cost**: ~$0.16/minute (10x Linux cost)
- **Typical build**: 15-20 minutes = ~$3.20 per build
- **Monthly estimate**: 100 builds = ~$320/month

### **Self-Hosted Runners:**
- **Setup cost**: Your existing Mac hardware
- **Operating cost**: Electricity + internet
- **Ongoing cost**: ~$0 per build

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review the created workflow file
2. **Setup**: Configure self-hosted runner on your Mac  
3. **Test**: Run initial builds to validate functionality
4. **Iterate**: Refine workflow based on results
5. **Scale**: Add cloud runners when they become widely available

The GitHub Actions pipeline transforms your build process from manual steps to professional CI/CD automation while maintaining the ARM64 native performance you've achieved.
