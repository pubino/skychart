- **Proper library deployment** - WCS library and Qt5Pas framework integration
- **Environment configuration** - DYLD paths and framework setup
- **Data directory management** - Symlinks and search path configuration

### Distribution Packages
- **SkyChart.app** - Complete macOS application bundle (193MB)
- **SkyChart-*.dmg** - Distribution disk image (61MB)
- **Code signing ready** - Prepared for Apple Developer Program
- **Notarization support** - Apple security compliance

## Build Process Automation

### Before (Manual)
- Complex multi-step process requiring deep technical knowledge
- Manual dependency compilation (8 separate commands)
- Manual environment setup and library deployment
- Inconsistent results and frequent build failures

### After (Automated)
```bash
# Three simple commands for complete build and distribution
./build_dependencies.sh
./build_macos_arm64.sh  
./package_macos.sh all
```

## Quality Assurance

### Testing and Verification
- **Comprehensive test suite** - `test_build.sh` validates all components
- **Architecture verification** - Confirms ARM64 native compilation
- **Runtime testing** - Application launch and environment verification
- **Build artifact validation** - File sizes, architectures, and dependencies

### Documentation Quality
- **User-focused** - Clear instructions for both users and developers
- **Comprehensive coverage** - From prerequisites to advanced distribution
- **Professional presentation** - Table of contents and structured sections
- **Troubleshooting support** - Common issues and solutions documented
